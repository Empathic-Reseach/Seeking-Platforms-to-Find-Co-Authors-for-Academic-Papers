I'm looking for platforms or websites where I can find potential co-authors for writing academic papers. I have a collection of 200 internet posts and a 30-page Word document that could serve as a foundation for research articles. I'm interested in collaborating with others to enhance the quality and depth of the papers.

If such platforms do not exist, I have created a sample business plan for an online platform called the **Academic Collaborations Network**, which aims to facilitate academic collaboration and co-authoring. This plan outlines features like user-friendly interfaces, a database of research articles, and community forums for discussion.

You can view the sample business plan here: [Business Plan Sample](https://1drv.ms/w/s!Au0yiAtjNUdzlnQBJqhB_cr5lUXk?e=Ql2fgp)

The above docx bussiness plan made by the automatic making business plan project which is [free and fast bussiness plan maker](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sosa123454321/Bussiness-plan-maker-2)

So the main question is that : What are the best forums or communities where I can post my request or connect with individuals interested in academic writing collaboration? Any suggestions for specific websites or strategies to find co-authors would be greatly appreciated!

Update 1:

So the many reports like academic proposal and other report are available in [here as shown below](https://share.multcloud.link/share/601679bd-d428-42c7-8a31-6d6c875eced6) and I am search for co-auther for writing a academic paper about them:

Finally as I know this question is not outside of the tour of this forum but thanks for the moderators which give the negative comments!!!

After that I would use the AI power for it's compassion and creat the ai robot to write the academic paper based of the proposal on these reports automatically.

As I guess the many of the Humana kind experts are so dark and finding the ligth and empathic experts of humans kind is wasting my time by this kind of question!!

sample post is available at below tooðŸ‘‡:
